    "Safety engineering is the application of basic scientic and technical principles to mitigation or reduction of loss of life, property, and the environment by recognized hazards (potential source of harm). It requires a broad knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and other basic sciences and a familiarity with one or more of the recognized branches of engineering.\n",

    "\n",
    "Standards make the world operate more smoothly (things like staircase step size, card sizes and parking distribution). The standards can be seen everywhere in Denmark, the window standard, the bottle standard, how the flag should be hanging, chairs and desks at schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standards are very important, since they provide the essential requirements, specifications, guidelines and characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that meterials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose. You can think of it as a common \"language\" that makes sure everyone understands something equily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its very common to use standards, to ensure that products comply with regulations, but it isn't required by law. But if you choose to not use standards, you will have a difficult time providing the specifikations needed to not use them, since they still need to live up to requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standards are a voluntary market instrument, consensus-dirven (agreed upon by a group in a comitee) and adopted by a recognized body. Standards can set requirements, example; construction (paper formats, threads, data formats), systems (quality management, risk assessment, environmental management), performance (breaking strength, safety, ergonomics, noise, radiation) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard itself is standardized (what?), meaning each standard has an introduction, preface, a scope of which it is applied for, normative references, definitions, symbols and abbreviations, requirements (functional requirements, e.g. test methods), annex A (normative), annex B (informative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of standards exist, De Jure and de facto standards. De jue are formal standards, voluntary, consensus-based, created in an open process and approved by a formal standardization orginzation. De facto is consortia / market dominance, industry standards, non-conensus-based and follows a closed process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standards are drawn up in committees and working groups consisting of experts with an interest in the subject of the standard. A committee has an average of ten members from different industries in DK, and works with a portfolio of standards appropriate to the technical area of the committee. Some standards are under revision, others are entirely new standards. Standards have to be revised every 5 years, due to technology advancing so fast.\n",

    "## **CE marking and the Machinery Regulations**\n",
    "The CE marking is a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA*). The CE marking is also found on products sold outside the EEA that are manufactured in, or designed to be sold in, the EEA. This makes the CE marking recognizable worldwide even to people who are not familiar with EEA.\n",
    "- The CE mark doesnt mean quality, but only that it meets the essential requirements, regarding safety, health and environment.\n",
