    "Safety engineering is the application of basic scientic and technical principles to mitigation or reduction of loss of life, property, and the environment by recognized hazards (potential source of harm). It requires a broad knowledge of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and other basic sciences and a familiarity with one or more of the recognized branches of engineering.\n",
